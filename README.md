# House-Price-Prediction-ML – Kaggle Regression Project

This project is based on Kaggle’s [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts housing prices using a variety of numeric and categorical features.
